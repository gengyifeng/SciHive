SciHive is implemented as a plugin for analyzing large scientific datasets in Hive. It currently supports NetCDF file format.

Hncdump is ported as ncdump for NetCDF files in HDFS. It is also helpful to create a table according to the structure of the NetCDF file. Please run "./hncdump -h" to see the usage.
