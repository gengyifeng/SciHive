This is the SciHive patch for hive-0.10.0. hive-0.10.0 can be downloaded from http://archive.apache.org/dist/hive.

You can use the patch file to rebuild the hive-0.10.0 with hadoop-1.0.4
For convenience, the compiled jars are also provided in the lib directory. You can use the jars without rebuild the source code. 

You also need the modified NetCDF java library to read the NetCDF files in HDFS.
You can download the modified library from https://github.com/gengyifeng/NetCDF-Java-Hadoop.

There are several inputformats in the contrib package. NcFileInputFormat is recommended for common use. NcFileSimpleInputFormat simply reads the whole array from the file and maps the array to a table. The filtering is done only in Hive. NcFileRangeInputFormat is used for arrays that have all dimenisons storing sorted values. So the dimesional boundaries can be calculated using binary search. IndexedNcFileInputFormat works with an index. The array is divided into blocks and the value range of each block is recorded in the index. The index is built into HBase along with the query processing automatically. You don't need to built the index before querying. Please make sure the HBase is properly set up for Hadoop and Hive before using it.
