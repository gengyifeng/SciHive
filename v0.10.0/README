This is the SciHive patch for hive-0.10.0

You can use the patch file to rebuild the hive-0.10.0 with hadoop-1.0.4
For convenience, the compiled jars are also provided in the lib directory.

You also need the modified NetCDF java library to read the NetCDF files in HDFS.
You can download the modified library from https://github.com/gengyifeng/NetCDF-Java-Hadoop.

There are three inputformats in the contrib package. NcFileInputFormat is recommended for common use. NcFileSimpleInputFormat is less efficient and NcFileRangeInputFormat is used for special NetCDF files. NcFileSerDe is the the SerDe for NetCDF file format.
